This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app uses React to allow users to enter pros and cons of a decision, along with weights for each decision. The app will total weights for pros and weights for cons listed, and subtract pros from cons, to determine if a user should make a decision in the affirmative or not. 

The app can be used here:
